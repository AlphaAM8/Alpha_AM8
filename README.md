# User Registration System

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Python-based user registration system that validates user input such as username, password, and email. The system ensures no duplicate usernames are registered, checks password strength (minimum 8 characters), and verifies that email formats are valid. The project includes automated tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.

## Features

- Register users with validation checks.
- Ensure password length is at least 8 characters.
- Check for valid email format.
- Prevent duplicate usernames.
- Test cases for different scenarios.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlphaAM8/Alpha_AM8.git
   cd Alpha_AM8
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Code Explanation

### User Registration Class

The core of this project is the `UserRegistration` class. It validates user input for username, password, and email and then registers the user if all inputs are valid. Here's the full code for the registration logic:

```python
class UserRegistration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users_db = {}

    def register_user(self, username, password, email):
        if username in self.users_db:
            return "Username already taken"
        if len(password) < 8:
            return "Password too short"
        if not self.is_valid_email(email):
            return "Invalid email"
        self.users_db[username] = {"password": password, "email": email}
        return "Registration successful"
    
    def is_valid_email(self, email):
        if '@' in email and '.' in email.split('@')[1]:
            return True
        return False
```

This `UserRegistration` class ensures that:
- Duplicate usernames are not allowed.
- Passwords are at least 8 characters long.
- Emails must follow the standard format (`username@domain.com`).

## Test Cases

The project includes several test cases to ensure the functionality of the user registration system.

### Test Case 1: Successful Registration

```python
def test_register_user_success():
    reg = UserRegistration()
    result = reg.register_user("john_doe", "password123", "john.doe@example.com")
    assert result == "Registration successful"
```

This test ensures that the user is successfully registered when providing valid credentials.

### Test Case 2: Duplicate Username

```python
def test_register_user_duplicate():
    reg = UserRegistration()
    reg.register_user("john_doe", "password123", "john.doe@example.com")
    result = reg.register_user("john_doe", "newpassword", "john.doe2@example.com")
    assert result == "Username already taken"
```

This test case ensures that the system doesn't allow duplicate usernames.

### Test Case 3: Short Password

```python
def test_register_user_short_password():
    reg = UserRegistration()
    result = reg.register_user("john_doe", "pass", "john.doe@example.com")
    assert result == "Password too short"
```

This test checks that the system rejects passwords that are shorter than 8 characters.

### Test Case 4: Invalid Email Format

```python
def test_register_user_invalid_email():
    reg = UserRegistration()
    result = reg.register_user("john_doe", "password123", "john.doe.com")
    assert result == "Invalid email"
```

This test ensures that the system rejects email addresses that don't contain the `@` symbol or a valid domain.

### Test Case 5: Email Without Domain

```python
def test_register_user_invalid_email_no_domain():
    reg = UserRegistration()
    result = reg.register_user("john_doe", "password123", "john@.com")
    assert result == "Invalid email"
```

This test checks that an email without a domain is considered invalid.

### Test Case 6: Check if User is Registered

```python
def test_is_user_registered():
    reg = UserRegistration()
    reg.register_user("john_doe", "password123", "john.doe@example.com")
    result = reg.is_user_registered("john_doe")
    assert result == True
```

This test verifies if the system can check if a user is successfully registered.

### Test Case 7: Check if User is Not Registered

```python
def test_is_user_not_registered():
    reg = UserRegistration()
    result = reg.is_user_registered("non_existent_user")
    assert result == False
```

This test ensures that the system correctly identifies when a user is not registered.

## Running the Tests

To run the test cases and validate the registration logic, use the following command:

```bash
pytest test_registration.py --no-header --no-summary -q
```

This will execute all the tests defined in `test_registration.py` and show the results in a concise format.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a user registration system with proper input validation, including checks for valid emails, username uniqueness, and password strength. Automated tests ensure that the system behaves as expected in various scenarios. This system can be extended and integrated into larger applications that require user registration functionality.
